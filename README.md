# Instructions

## Python App

make sure to add your models to the folder

    cd application
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ..
    python application/app.py

## Front End

In a new command line:

    cd chatbot
    npm install
    npm start

## Git Instructions

To get the repo (clone it) to your local machine, use this command in the directory you want to load into:

``git clone https://github.com/ShouryaRSharma/NLPCW.git``

If you make any changes to the code, you can use the following commands to push those changes back into this repo:

``git add .``

This makes a note of all the code changes you make in application, chatbot frontend, or the dockerfile to your local repository. NOTE: If you update the model, it won't be put into github. We are keeping these local.

``git commit -m "write what you changed here"``

This commits all your changes to your local repository. Write what you changed so we can tell what you did at this stage.

``git push``

You might be asked to sign in as well when you do this.
